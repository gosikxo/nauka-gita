            Mama, take this badge from me<br />
            I can't use it anymore<br />
            It's gettin' dark, too dark to see<br />
            Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
        </p>
        <p>
            Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey hey yeah<br />
            Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh<br />
            Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh yeah<br />
            Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ayy hey yeah<br />
            Oh, yeah, oh yeah, aw
        </p>
        <p>
            Mama, put my guns in the ground (Ooh)<br />
            I can't shoot them anymore (Ooh)<br />
            That cold black cloud is comin' down (Ooh)<br />
            Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door (Ooh)
        </p>
        <p>
            Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey hey yeah<br />
            Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door<br />
            Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh yeah<br />
            Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ayy hey yeah<br />
            Ooh
        </p>
